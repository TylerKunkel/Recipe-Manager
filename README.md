# Recipe-Manager

The goal of this project is to create a recipe manager application that allows users to add, view, and search for recipes. The project will be written in Python, and it will utilize file input/output to store and retrieve recipe data.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps we'll need to take to create the recipe manager:

Create a recipe class: We'll create a Recipe class that will store information about each recipe, such as the recipe name, ingredients, and instructions.

Create a recipe manager class: We'll create a RecipeManager class that will contain a list of Recipe objects. This class will allow us to add, view, and search for recipes.

Implement user input: We'll prompt the user to input their desired action, such as adding a recipe, viewing the recipe list, or searching for a recipe.

Add recipes: When the user selects the "add recipe" option, we'll prompt them to input the recipe name, ingredients, and instructions. We'll then create a Recipe object with this information and add it to the recipe manager.

View recipes: When the user selects the "view recipes" option, we'll display all of the recipes in the recipe manager.

Search for recipes: When the user selects the "search for recipe" option, we'll prompt them to enter a search query. We'll then search through the recipe names and ingredients to find any recipes that match the search query, and display the results.

Save recipes to a file: We'll use file input/output to save the current state of the recipe manager to a file, so that the user can exit the program and come back later to continue working on their recipes.

Load recipes from a file: When the user starts the program, we'll load the recipe data from the file and populate the recipe manager with any recipes that were previously added.
